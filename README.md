Pancake Mahjong is an inofficial Saki mahjong game
with high-quality occult implementation.

## Features

- (TODO)

## Build

The client can be built on Linux, Windows, or macOS with
Qt 5.7.1 or later installed.
The target platform can be Linux, Windows, macOS, or Android. 
We will also test supporting for iOS in the future.

To obtain an executable client, build it either by the Qt Creator or from the command line:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mjpancake/mjpancake-client.git
mkdir build && cd build
qmake -config release ../mjpancake-client
make (or nmake, or mingw32-make according to your environment)
```
